# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system that provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences. The system uses movie genres to compute similarity scores and recommend movies that align with the user's input.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Loads and cleans movie and rating data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts movie genres into a matrix of token counts using CountVectorizer.
- **Similarity Computation**: Calculates cosine similarity between movies to identify similar ones.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provides movie recommendations based on user input.
